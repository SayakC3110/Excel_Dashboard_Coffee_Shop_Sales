# Coffee Shop Sales Analysis
The main objective of this project is to analyze retail sales data to gain actionable insights and create a dashboard reflecting KPIs that will enhance the performance of the Coffee Business.

## Questions by the stakeholders

- How do sales vary by day of the
week and hour of the day?
- Are there any peak times for sales
activity?
- What is the total sales revenue for
each month?
- How do sales vary across different
store locations?
- what is the average price/order
per person
- Which products are the best-
selling in terms of quantity and
revenue?
- How do sales vary by product
category and type?

## Recommended Analysis
- Cleaned and transformed the data using power query.
- Create a data model and make pivot tables and a few measures for the KPIs.
- Prepared the dashboard and applied a coffee theme to the Slicers and Charts.

## My suggestions for the business
- We should look into the lowest-selling product categories and include coupons with orders for the said categories, this way customers could develop an interest in those products and the sales could gain some momentum.
- If not done already, offering combo deals with Bakery items and Coffee or Tea products might boost Bakery item sales.
